                <h2>My Whole World</h2>
                <p><b>Hello! This is khebang Family. </b>I love my family so much.
                    Santosh Kumar Khebang Limbu(My Father),Sirjana Magar(My Mom),Shalu Khebang(me)
                    & Sesehang Khebang(My little bro), Everyone in our family has name that starts from S.
                    so,it is a 4S family.My mother and father had done inter caste marrigae and it was very 
                    difficult for them at first but then, they really worked hard to make our family in this place.
                     My father used to stay at aboard and work there and my mom had worked at INGOS.NGOS etc and now,
                     she is working at CO-operatives. My mom is super fast . I mean when morning starts, she cooks food for us
                      and then,so all ktchen works,school stuffs for brother and there are pigs in our home so she feeds them and 
                      also she loves gardening and we have lots of fruits,vegetables and flowers. My mom is ver hardworking and I do 
                      look up to her.For me ,Family is my first priority and will always love them.
